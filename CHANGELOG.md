## [Unreleased]

### Added

-   This CHANGELOG file to track releases better.

### Changed

-   Adjusted default `[Chat] LineSpacing` to `-45` to avoid overlap with large characters such as brackets.
-   Refactored README.md config table to better show range of valid values.
-   Renamed `CurrentCulture` class to `CurrencyCulture` to match the file and patch name.

### Fixed

-   Configuration adjusted to work with RepoConfig, though a game restart is currently required ([#18](https://github.com/CCarrMcMahon/repo-essentials/issues/18)).
